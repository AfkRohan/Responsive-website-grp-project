He replied to me very quickly and we started to discuss the best itinerary for the things that I wanted to do with my camera. It was my first workshop and I truly enjoyed it. He gave me some useful tips to shoot nice pics at night, portrait and landscape mode pics as well as the opportunity to practice with him and it was super helpful. I totally recommend it”

               He was quickly able to identify my needs and we started grabbing shots around London. I couldn’t recommend the workshop enough, far too often we use means such as YouTube to learn our craft but you can’t beat some on field experience...
               I still use the techniques learned to this day and I know my eye is able to find pictures I wouldn’t previously of thought of.”
