               ‚ÄúI decided to reach out to him because I wanted to learn how to use a camera in manual mode and familiarise with the various settings. He replied to me very quickly and we started to discuss the best itinerary for the things that I wanted to do with my camera. It was my first workshop and I truly enjoyed it. He gave me some useful tips to shoot nice pics at night, portrait and landscape mode pics as well as the opportunity to practice with him and it was super helpful. I totally recommend it‚Äù

               ‚Äú4 months after taking up photography I decided I needed some help to get to the next level and luckily I found Chris offered a workshop...
               He was quickly able to identify my needs and we started grabbing shots around London. I couldn‚Äôt recommend the workshop enough, far too often we use means such as YouTube to learn our craft but you can‚Äôt beat some on field experience...
               I still use the techniques learned to this day and I know my eye is able to find pictures I wouldn‚Äôt previously of thought of.‚Äù
